# go-next-threaded

This repository is for learning and practicing Go backend development and Next.js frontend development with server-side rendering (SSR). The repository consists of two directories, `backend` and `frontend`, each containing their respective codebases.

## Backend

The `backend` directory contains a REST API implemented in Go using the [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) router. The API exposes various endpoints that can be consumed by the frontend to retrieve and manipulate data. The API code is designed to be testable, and the repository includes a suite of tests that cover the API's functionality.

## Frontend

The `frontend` directory contains a Next.js web application that utilizes server-side rendering (SSR) to improve performance and provide a better user experience. The frontend is designed to consume data from the backend REST API and display it to the user. The repository includes tests that cover the frontend's functionality, including integration tests that verify the interaction between the frontend and the backend.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine and follow the instructions in the `README.md` files in the `backend` and `frontend` directories. You will need to have Go and Node.js installed on your machine to build and run the code.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for learning and practicing development skills. If you have any suggestions or improvements to the code, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. However, please note that this repository is not intended for production use, and any contributions should be focused on learning and improving development skills.
